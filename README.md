# Flood Prediction Warning System

An automated system designed to predict and provide warnings for potential flood events. It uses real-time or near-real-time water height data, a predictive model, and various alerting mechanisms to assess and communicate flood risk.

## Overview

This system is designed to:

  * Monitor water level/height data from external sources, such as **remote sensors or web-based URLs**.

  * Use a **predictive model** to assess flood risk or forecast expected flood heights.

  * Send **warnings and alerts** (e.g., via email or to remote services) when flood thresholds are exceeded or when the prediction indicates a high-risk situation.

  * Provide interfaces (e.g., a web front-end or API) to access the predicted or current water height data.

  * Integrate with external data platforms or dashboards, such as **Thingspeak**, for data visualization and telemetry.

## Main Components

| File / Module | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `main.py` | The central entry point for the system, responsible for orchestrating the workflow: reading data, invoking the predictive model, and triggering alerts. |
| `flood_model.py` | Contains the machine learning or statistical code used to predict flood height and assess risk. |
| `auto_email_sender.py` | Manages and sends email alerts or notifications when specific conditions are met. |
| `thingspeak_sender.py` | Handles sending data points (current readings or predictions) to the Thingspeak service for remote monitoring. |
| `read_height_by_url_example.py` | An example script demonstrating how to fetch water height data from a remote URL. |
| `receiver.py` | A module that can be used to handle incoming data or webhooks from external sources. |
| `twd97_to_wgs84.py` | A utility for converting geographical coordinates from the TWD97 system to WGS84, useful for mapping and geospatial applications. |
| `args.py` | Manages command-line arguments and configuration parameters to customize how the system runs. |
| `static/`, `templates/` | Stores the assets for a web front-end, including CSS, JavaScript, images, and HTML templates. |
| `test_python/`, `test_web/` | Contains the test suites for various parts of the system, including Python logic and the web interface. |

## Data & Utilities

  * **Data Ingestion:** The system is designed to read water height and level measurements from web-based URLs or direct sensor connections.

  * **Geospatial Conversion:** A dedicated utility module is included to handle coordinate transformations when required for mapping or data integration.

  * **External Service Integration:** The system uses external services like **email providers** and **Thingspeak** to send data and alerts.

## Intended Audience & Use Cases

This project is useful for:

  * **Civil engineering and environmental monitoring** teams looking to build robust flood monitoring systems.

  * **Researchers and students** working on hydrology and flood risk modeling.

  * **Local authorities** who require an early warning system for flood events.

  * Anyone interested in integrating a wide range of technologies: geospatial conversion, remote sensing, real-time data ingestion, predictive modeling, and automated alerting.

## Technologies Used

  * **Python**: The core logic, predictive model, and utilities are all built with Python.

  * **Web / HTTP**: Used for fetching data from remote URLs.

  * **External Services**: Integration with external services for telemetry (`Thingspeak`) and notifications (`Email`).

  * **Coordinate System Utilities**: For geospatial data transformation.

  * **Test Suites**: Included to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system.
